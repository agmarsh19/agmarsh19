- Howdy y'all, I’m @agmarsh19
- I use nanopore sequencing and data analysis pipelines for bacterial abundance and diversity studies
- I’m currently a biotech PhD student at Clarkson University 
- Relatively new to bioinformatics but I'm always open to learn more
- Still on a mission to find an alternative 16S rRNA classification pipeline, specifically designed for nanopore sequencing FastQ outputs
- You can reach me @marshaag@clarkson.edu
